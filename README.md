# WOMBAT
Warehouse Observation Mobile Bot for Autonomous Tasks

# Concept
Designed for autonomous warehouse tasks, including SLAM and stock monitoring. Making use of LiDAR readings, ICP, EKF, differential drive control and kinematic predictions, WOMBAT can map its surroundings while having an understanding of its position in the map. The objects recognized as stock are scanned using QR codes and searched inside a non-relational database (using Google's Firebase).
